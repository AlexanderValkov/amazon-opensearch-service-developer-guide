# Getting started with security in Amazon OpenSearch Serverless<a name="serverless-tutorials"></a>

****  
***This is prerelease documentation for Amazon OpenSearch Serverless, which is in preview release\. The documentation and the feature are both subject to change\. We recommend that you use this feature only in test environments, and not in production environments\. For preview terms and conditions, see *Beta Service Participation* in [AWS Service Terms](https://aws.amazon.com/service-terms/)\. *** 

The following tutorials help you get started using Amazon OpenSearch Serverless\. Both tutorials accomplish the same basic steps, but one uses the console while the other uses the AWS CLI\.

Note that the use cases in these tutorials are simplified\. The network and security policies are fairly open\. In production workloads, we recommend that you configure more robust security features such as SAML authentication, VPC access, and restrictive data access policies\.
